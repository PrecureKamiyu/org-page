Machine learning contributes to trajectory prediction for VRUs (vulnerable road users) in several key ways:

1. **Data Processing**: Machine learning algorithms, particularly regression techniques, are utilized to process historical geospatial data from vehicles and VRUs. This allows for the forecasting of future positions based on past movements, enabling the prediction of trajectories [T5].

2. **Accuracy Improvement**: By employing advanced machine learning models, such as recurrent neural networks, the research aims to enhance the accuracy of trajectory predictions. These models can analyze complex patterns in the data, leading to improved position error accuracy within specified time windows (e.g., achieving a position error accuracy of 3.34 meters in a 5-second prediction window) [T4].

3. **Collision Probability Estimation**: Machine learning techniques are also used to estimate the probability of collision by analyzing predicted trajectories. If the predicted paths of vehicles and VRUs overlap, the system can assess the risk of collision and issue warnings accordingly [T3].

4. **Real-time Processing**: The integration of machine learning with V2X communications allows for real-time processing of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) from vehicles and VRUs. This facilitates timely trajectory predictions and enhances the overall effectiveness of collision avoidance systems [T5].

Overall, machine learning enhances the capability to predict VRU movements accurately and efficiently, thereby improving safety in urban environments.
